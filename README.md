#palle.java

This is the .java file in which I used the jsoup libraries inorder to extract the data from a url and commit the extracted details into a product_details.csv file.
in palle.java file 
where palle is the main class 
and in the product class where all the getter() methods are revoked inorder to implement the url data in form of fields of the .csv file
